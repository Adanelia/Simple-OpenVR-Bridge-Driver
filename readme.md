# OpenVR Driver Examples

This repo contains a set of OpenVR driver examples I have written for you to copy, use, and learn from using c++17. I have tried my best to add useful comments to make it easier to understand what everything means, but if you have any other questions, or want to contribute, please raise an issue.

I originally planned some more examples for this but my interests have moved elsewhere, so I'm posting this update as-is.

### Projects

1. Basic Setup (Tracked HMD & Controllers)
2. Trackers
3. Compositor (Custom Compositor Window) (Incomplete)

### Building

Clone this repository and the submodule(s) using

```bat
git clone --recursive <repository url here>
```

And build with CMake
